      <p>I'm a proffessional athlete and I've been competing almost non-stop since I started archery back in 2010.</p>
      <p>In that time I've progressed from club competitions, student leagues and country championships to climbing the podium in the National Tour, Indoor World series and World Cup.</p>
      <p>In 2021 I represented GB at my first Olympic games, and I plan to carry on for much longer as I keep developing in the sport.</p>

      <p>I love to help others improve their archery, health and fitness.</p>
      <p>Fusing experience gained from shooting at international level, and a drive to understand top archers training methods, I aim to help people achieve their best by working smarter and getting the most out of whatever time they have available.</p>

      <p>With archery being such a time consuiming and immersive sport, it's really important to me to have other activities and hobbies outside of it!</p>
      <p>Some of my favourite other sports include running, hiking and climbing, with the occasional pick up game of frisbee.</p>
      <p>In the house I keep my mind sharp learning to code, including writing this website!</p>
