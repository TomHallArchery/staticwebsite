WHAT
WHY
HOW

I've been coaching in some form or another for almost as long as I've been shooting. From teaching beginners at the university, to running team fitness and training sessions, county squad days and more. Recently I've run online bow training classes, as well as running full coaching days at the Podium Bowstrings annual training camps. Now I work with individuals, small or large groups to help improve all aspects of shooting, from the key elements of technique, fitness and setup, to all of the fine details picked up from over a decade of competition experience.
