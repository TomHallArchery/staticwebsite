I watched this recently and it was a delightful way to spend 12 minutes of my life.

[Archery's Biggest Fan- Olympic Channel](http://www.olympicchannel.com/en/playback/groupies/groupies/archerys-fan-of-the-year-finds-his-path-through-autism-with-the-sport/)

If you enjoy taking part in or watching archery or just want to see a slightly different perspective on a sport that is usually a bit niche and outside the public eye, this is a great piece.

I really like seeing how people react to Andrew's obsessive behavior in watching every match, following all the results and travelling around the world to spectate. It's really refreshing to see this autistic trait viewed as a positive; he is seen as being unusually dedicated and enthusiastic and duly rewarded for his efforts!

As an athlete and natural competitor I understand the benefits world class competition bring to me personally, but I sometimes wonder what it actually does for other people who aren't aspiring international competitors. The reaction of someone like Andrew to icons of the sport like Brady Ellison shows just how much the international circuit can enrich the life of those outside it, and makes me happy and [proud to be a part of it](https://tomhall2016.wordpress.com/2017/02/22/world-cup-finals/).

Speaking of which I do get in a glimpse of screen time as well. It's awesome how watching those matches brings the feelings of intensity rushing straight back, like re-watching a big game on the TV that you were there for on the day. It's one of the reasons I think world cup events need to cater for big venue audiences as well as the live stream!
