Its been a busy few weeks since I last posted! In that time I've won the Back2Back UK and came third at the National Indoors, turned my bow into a Christmas decoration (see below; it balances quite nicely! ), done loads of form work and training at Lilleshall and qualified for the European Indoors with scores of 585, 582 and 582 on WA 18m rounds.

Of course its all go now the break is over, with a thesis to write in the next few months as well as all the shooting, but I'm counting this blog as writing practice. Tomorrow I've got a longer post coming that I've been working on for a while, about something new and blue*... Stay tuned!
