Major competition results

## National Tour 2019
Champion! After four years entering as number one seed, I battled through extreme winds to claim the big domestic circuit win.

## World Championships 2019
The best start to qualifying I've had yet, opening with a 60 to lead the 200+ strong field. And converting it into crucial team quota places for tokyo with a 6-0 victory over Japan in the 1/8 round.

## Antalya World Cup 2018
Ending a 6 year wait to see a GB team make the finals field at a world cup, I got my first world cup medal with Patrick Huston and Alex Wise.

## Nimes 2017
A pb in qualifying of 588 at 18m, a dream run through the matches to make the finals field, and a 4th place finish make this one of the big breakthrough events of my career, and set me up for my first full season on the GB team

## BUCS Indoors 2015
Individual and team Gold

## BUCS H2H 2013
My first ever H2H competition was my first ever win at BUCS. I still don't understand how I did it but I shot matches far above my qualifying level in the early rounds and finals, and walked away with a surprise gold medal ![]()
