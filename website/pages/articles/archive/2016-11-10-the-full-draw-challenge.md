Some of you may remember being nominated for this on facebook, posting a picture a day for ten days and temporarily blocking out the usual torrent of #hashtags. As entertaining as this was, the craze has now passed, and I decided it was time to steal the name for something a bit more physically demanding at the end of Thursdays club session...

After "persuading" ten people to play ("erm" means yes in my book), we began with the ranking round, a maximum hold at full draw. Split into groups of 2 and 3, the top four would go through to the semi finals. In my group the order of holds almost perfectly followed the order of scores on the round earlier, with strong efforts from James and Hannah, while Tim and Craig's heat was all over quite quickly. Tim's camera got a bit excited in the warmth and now has a permanent "spooky mist" filter...

Enrik comfortably dispatched last years novices Jack and Chi in his heat, showing just how much strength he's built up in the last year. And finally Chris and James went head to head in the compound heat, which we were all pretty interested to watch! It turns out that there does seem to be quite a lot of physical effort involved, James had to let down after a huge twitch and Chris looked pretty strained as he went past the minute marker...

So the Semi finals involved holding for half the time immediately followed by a single arrow shoot-off! Enrik was once again solid and dispatched Jeffs, but mine and Hannah's shoot off was too close to call, even after measuring! A second shoot off went my way and we were set for the show down.

Me vs Enrik was set for an epic hold-off. At first it seemed to be going his way, he was still looking rock solid as I began to shake visibly, but to everyone's surprise he conceded at the xx second mark, allowing me to grit through just a little longer and secure the win. Once again Tim's camera makes this look like we're underwater... perhaps that could be a more extreme version of the game in future?

Much fun had by all! With the game doubling as a sneaky test for bow fitness, it was pretty good to see lots of people able to go over the 20s mark. I reckon this could catch on, so perhaps Birmingham, Oxford, Loughborough or Nottingham will take up the challenge and see if we can get a recurve over the one minute mark!
