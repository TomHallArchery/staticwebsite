Its been a busy few weeks recently! I'm really getting stuck into the technical work now, building in some important changes to my form while still keeping the good elements. Here's a couple of videos taken a week apart showing some of the progress. 

Week 1. Already a lot of new stuff since the national series, it takes a lot of effort to find the anchor.

Week 2. Weirdly enough it got warmer at the end of October? A bit unstable in the torso but the release has been cleaned up a lot:

Lots of work still to do, but it feels like things are coming together. What are you working on right now? With some focused training sessions and a helpful eye you'll be surprised how much progress you can make in a week.
